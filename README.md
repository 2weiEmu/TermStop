# TermStop
A basic terminal stopwatch written in C, partially as practice and also because I wanted it.
Written in basic c. You only need gcc to compile it and nothing special otherwise. For all I know this works only on Linux, you can try MacOS. Windows, I doubt.

## Use
```
$ termstop [-a -s -q -v] [-t us-sleep] [-f save-file] [-d delimiter]
```

See the `man` page for an explanation of the options.

## Controls
Press <ENTER> to create a new split.

Press 'h' to stop the program.

## Installation / Use

```bash
$ sudo make install
```
